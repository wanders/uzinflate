     Initializes the internal stream state for decompression. The fields
   next_in, avail_in, zalloc, zfree and opaque must be initialized before by
   the caller. If next_in is not Z_NULL and avail_in is large enough (the exact
   value depends on the compression method), inflateInit determines the
   compression method from the zlib header and allocates all data structures
   accordingly; otherwise the allocation will be deferred to the first call of
   inflate.  If zalloc and zfree are set to Z_NULL, inflateInit updates them to
   use default allocation functions.

     inflateInit returns Z_OK if success, Z_MEM_ERROR if there was not enough
   memory, Z_VERSION_ERROR if the zlib library version is incompatible with the
   version assumed by the caller.  msg is set to null if there is no error
   message. inflateInit does not perform any decompression apart from reading
   the zlib header if present: this will be done by inflate().  (So next_in and
   avail_in may be modified, but next_out and avail_out are unchanged.)

int inflate (z_streamp strm, int flush);
/*
    inflate decompresses as much data as possible, and stops when the input
  buffer becomes empty or the output buffer becomes full. It may introduce
  some output latency (reading input without producing any output) except when
  forced to flush.

  The detailed semantics are as follows. inflate performs one or both of the
  following actions:

  - Decompress more input starting at next_in and update next_in and avail_in
    accordingly. If not all input can be processed (because there is not
    enough room in the output buffer), next_in is updated and processing
    will resume at this point for the next call of inflate().

  - Provide more output starting at next_out and update next_out and avail_out
    accordingly.  inflate() provides as much output as possible, until there
    is no more input data or no more space in the output buffer (see below
    about the flush parameter).

  Before the call of inflate(), the application should ensure that at least
  one of the actions is possible, by providing more input and/or consuming
  more output, and updating the next_* and avail_* values accordingly.
  The application can consume the uncompressed output when it wants, for
  example when the output buffer is full (avail_out == 0), or after each
  call of inflate(). If inflate returns Z_OK and with zero avail_out, it
  must be called again after making room in the output buffer because there
  might be more output pending.

    The flush parameter of inflate() can be Z_NO_FLUSH, Z_SYNC_FLUSH,
  Z_FINISH, or Z_BLOCK. Z_SYNC_FLUSH requests that inflate() flush as much
  output as possible to the output buffer. Z_BLOCK requests that inflate() stop
  if and when it gets to the next deflate block boundary. When decoding the
  zlib or gzip format, this will cause inflate() to return immediately after
  the header and before the first block. When doing a raw inflate, inflate()
  will go ahead and process the first block, and will return when it gets to
  the end of that block, or when it runs out of data.

    The Z_BLOCK option assists in appending to or combining deflate streams.
  Also to assist in this, on return inflate() will set strm->data_type to the
  number of unused bits in the last byte taken from strm->next_in, plus 64
  if inflate() is currently decoding the last block in the deflate stream,
  plus 128 if inflate() returned immediately after decoding an end-of-block
  code or decoding the complete header up to just before the first byte of the
  deflate stream. The end-of-block will not be indicated until all of the
  uncompressed data from that block has been written to strm->next_out.  The
  number of unused bits may in general be greater than seven, except when
  bit 7 of data_type is set, in which case the number of unused bits will be
  less than eight.

    inflate() should normally be called until it returns Z_STREAM_END or an
  error. However if all decompression is to be performed in a single step
  (a single call of inflate), the parameter flush should be set to
  Z_FINISH. In this case all pending input is processed and all pending
  output is flushed; avail_out must be large enough to hold all the
  uncompressed data. (The size of the uncompressed data may have been saved
  by the compressor for this purpose.) The next operation on this stream must
  be inflateEnd to deallocate the decompression state. The use of Z_FINISH
  is never required, but can be used to inform inflate that a faster approach
  may be used for the single inflate() call.

     In this implementation, inflate() always flushes as much output as
  possible to the output buffer, and always uses the faster approach on the
  first call. So the only effect of the flush parameter in this implementation
  is on the return value of inflate(), as noted below, or when it returns early
  because Z_BLOCK is used.

     If a preset dictionary is needed after this call (see inflateSetDictionary
  below), inflate sets strm->adler to the adler32 checksum of the dictionary
  chosen by the compressor and returns Z_NEED_DICT; otherwise it sets
  strm->adler to the adler32 checksum of all output produced so far (that is,
  total_out bytes) and returns Z_OK, Z_STREAM_END or an error code as described
  below. At the end of the stream, inflate() checks that its computed adler32
  checksum is equal to that saved by the compressor and returns Z_STREAM_END
  only if the checksum is correct.

    inflate() will decompress and check either zlib-wrapped or gzip-wrapped
  deflate data.  The header type is detected automatically.  Any information
  contained in the gzip header is not retained, so applications that need that
  information should instead use raw inflate, see inflateInit2() below, or
  inflateBack() and perform their own processing of the gzip header and
  trailer.

    inflate() returns Z_OK if some progress has been made (more input processed
  or more output produced), Z_STREAM_END if the end of the compressed data has
  been reached and all uncompressed output has been produced, Z_NEED_DICT if a
  preset dictionary is needed at this point, Z_DATA_ERROR if the input data was
  corrupted (input stream not conforming to the zlib format or incorrect check
  value), Z_STREAM_ERROR if the stream structure was inconsistent (for example
  if next_in or next_out was NULL), Z_MEM_ERROR if there was not enough memory,
  Z_BUF_ERROR if no progress is possible or if there was not enough room in the
  output buffer when Z_FINISH is used. Note that Z_BUF_ERROR is not fatal, and
  inflate() can be called again with more input and more output space to
  continue decompressing. If Z_DATA_ERROR is returned, the application may then
  call inflateSync() to look for a good compression block if a partial recovery
  of the data is desired.

int inflateEnd (z_streamp strm);
/*
     All dynamically allocated data structures for this stream are freed.
   This function discards any unprocessed input and does not flush any
   pending output.

     inflateEnd returns Z_OK if success, Z_STREAM_ERROR if the stream state
   was inconsistent. In the error case, msg may be set but then points to a
   static string (which must not be deallocated).
